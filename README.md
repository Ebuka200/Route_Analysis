# Route_Analysis
Airlines can boost profits by analyzing revenue data, refining prices, and optimizing routes. Key metrics include total revenue, revenue per ticket, and occupancy. While improving efficiency, airlines must balance profit with customer satisfaction and safety. A data-driven approach supports sustainable growth.

#✈️ Overview
This project analyzes airline routes to uncover insights that support better decision-making around profitability, route optimization, and operational efficiency. Using a combination of Python for data manipulation and SQL for querying structured datasets, the analysis highlights key metrics such as revenue, occupancy, and route performance.

#🎯 Objectives
-Analyze airline route data using SQL queries and Python Pandas.
-Calculate performance metrics: revenue per ticket, occupancy, and total revenue.
-Identify underperforming routes and opportunities for optimization.
-Visualize trends and support data-driven recommendations.

#🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3
Pandas
SQL (SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL — customize as needed)
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
Matplotlib / Seaborn (if you visualized results)
